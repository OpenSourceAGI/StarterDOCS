Search the web by sending a query via SearXNG metasearch engine of 100+
sources.

You can specify the type of content you want—such as general web results,

news articles, videos, images, science topics, files, or IT-related 

information—by choosing the appropriate category. 

Additional filters let you narrow results by recency (like results

from the past day, week, month, or year), language, and page number.

The API returns a structured list of results, each including a title, URL,
snippet, domain, and other useful details, making it easy to display or
analyze the information. This flexible and robust search tool is ideal for
apps, research projects, and any situation where up-to-date, diverse web data
is needed.
