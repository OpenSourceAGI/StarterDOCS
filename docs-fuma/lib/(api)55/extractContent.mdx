### ðŸšœðŸ“œ Tractor the Text Extractor 
1. Main Content Detection: Extract the main content from a URL by combining 
Mozilla Readability and Postlight Mercury algorithms, utilizing over 100 
custom adapters for major sites for article, author, date HTML classes.
2. Basic HTML Standardization: Transform complex HTML into a simplified 
reading-mode format of basic HTML, making it ideal for research note archival
  and focused reading, with headings, images and links.
3. YouTube Transcript Processing: When a YouTube video URL is detected, 
retrieve the complete video transcript including both manual captions and 
auto-generated subtitles, maintaining proper timestamp synchronization and 
speaker identification where available.
4. PDF to HTML: Process PDF documents by extracting
  formatted text while intelligently handling line breaks, page headers, 
  footnotes. The system analyzes text height statistics to automatically
  infer heading levels, creating a properly structured document hierarchy
  based on standard deviation from mean text size.
5. Citation Information Extraction: Identify and extract citation metadata
  including author names, publication dates, sources, and titles using HTML
  meta tags and common class name patterns. The system validates author names
  against a comprehensive database of 90,000 first and last names, 
distinguishing between personal and organizational authors to properly 
format citations.
6. Author Name Formatting: Process author names by checking against 
known name databases, handling affixes and titles correctly, and determining
  whether to reverse the name order based on whether it's a personal or 
organizational author, ensuring proper citation formatting.
