### Chargeback Fee Breakdown

**Chargeback costs vary significantly by processor:**

- **Square** offers the best value with **\$0 chargeback fees** and even refunds processing fees if you win disputes[^9][^10]
- **Stripe** charges **\$15 per chargeback** but does not refund this fee even if you win[^9][^11]
- **Helcim** charges **\$15 per chargeback** but **refunds the fee if you win** the dispute[^12][^13]
- **GoCardless** has **variable chargeback fees** depending on country - fees apply in US, Germany, and Austria only[^14]
- **Stax** typically charges **\$20-\$50 per chargeback** based on merchant agreement[^15][^16]
- **PaymentCloud** charges **\$25-\$50 per chargeback**, with higher fees for high-risk merchants[^17][^18]
- **Melio** has **minimal chargeback risk** due to B2B focus and ACH-heavy processing[^1][^4]


### Industry Context

Chargeback fees are becoming increasingly expensive across the industry, with costs expected to grow 24% from 2025 to 2028[^19]. The average chargeback value in the US is \$110, and each dispute costs financial institutions \$9.08-\$10.32 to process[^19]. For merchants, total chargeback costs include not just the fee but also the lost merchandise, administrative time, and potential monitoring program penalties[^20][^21].

**Square's zero chargeback fee policy** makes it particularly attractive for businesses concerned about dispute costs, while **Helcim's refund policy** provides a middle ground. **Melio's B2B focus** naturally reduces chargeback exposure since business-to-business payments have lower dispute rates than consumer transactions.

#  Astra Payments 
**Astra Payments** enables instant money transfers primarily by leveraging the **Visa Direct** network and partnerships with financial institutions like Cross River Bank. Here's how it works and what it costs:

- **Push-to-Card Technology:** Astra uses push-to-card payments, which means funds are sent directly from a bank account or card to a recipient's debit card. This is done using the Visa Direct real-time payment rails, enabling funds to appear instantly and be spendable right away[^1][^5][^6].
- **API Integration:** Developers and businesses can embed Astra's payment API into their products, allowing instant transfers between bank accounts and cards without needing to build complex payment infrastructures themselves[^1][^7].
- **No Cut-Off Times:** Transfers are processed instantly, regardless of weekends or holidays, with no waiting for ACH settlement windows[^4].
- **No Prefunding Required:** Astra handles settlement and reconciliation automatically, so businesses don't need to pre-fund accounts or manage operational complexity[^1][^5].
- **Security and Compliance:** The platform includes built-in compliance, fraud detection, and PCI-compliant SDKs for secure transactions[^1][^5].


### Cost Structure

- **Industry-Standard Fee:** For instant "push" payments to external debit cards, Astra typically charges an **industry-standard fee of 1.5% per transaction**[^2].
- **Cost-Plus Pricing:** Astra offers cost-plus pricing designed to scale with customer growth, making it less costly than traditional wire transfers and competitive with other instant payment providers[^5][^3].
- **Custom Fees:** Businesses can optionally apply programmatic fees to each transaction to generate additional revenue[^2].
- **No Additional Infrastructure Fees:** There's no need for additional compliance, capital commitments, or operational overhead for instant payments[^6].


### Summary Table

| Feature | Astra Payments Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Speed** | Instant (real-time, 24/7, including weekends/holidays) |
| **Method** | Push-to-card (Visa Direct), API integration |
| **Typical Fee** | 1.5% per transaction (industry standard) |
| **Pricing Model** | Cost-plus, scalable with business growth |
| **Operational Overhead** | No pre-funding, no extra compliance or capital required |
| **Security** | Built-in compliance, fraud detection, PCI-compliant |

**In essence:** Astra achieves instant payments by utilizing debit card rails (Visa Direct), with a typical cost of 1.5% per transaction and a scalable, cost-plus pricing model. The platform is designed for easy integration, security, and operational simplicity, making it attractive for fintechs, marketplaces, and businesses needing rapid, reliable fund movement[^1][^2][^5][^6].
